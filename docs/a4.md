# A4 - JavaScript Objects

Examine the code and comments in `objects-demo.js` and run the file. Make sure you understand how it all works.

Write a program in `objects-task.js` that includes the following:
- Creation of **two** of your own objects. Ideas you could use for your objects include a person, car, animal, country, etc. Anything would work if you can think of a number of *properties* or attributes associated with the object.
    - Upon creation, give each of your objects at least four properties, and make use of at least two different data types for your properties (string, number or boolean).
    - For each object, after its been created: print a property, change a property, add a property and delete a property.
    - Output each object to the screen after making the modifications stated above.
- Creation of a `URL` object, using a URL of your choice, similar to what is shown in the demo. After creation, output the URL object to the screen.
